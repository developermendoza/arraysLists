    <h1>Array Lists & Dynamic Arrays</h1>
    <h2>Array Lists</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript doesn't have a built-in ArrayList like some other languages do,
      but you can achieve similar functionality using the <b>Array</b> object's
      methods. And Array List, in general, is a dynamic array that can
      automatically resize itself when needed
    </p>

    <p><b>What are they used for?</b></p>
    <p>
      Array Lists (or similar dynamic arrays in JavaScript) are used when you
      wnat a flexible array that can grow or shrink in size dynamically. This is
      useful when the number of elements is not known in advance, and you want
      to avoid the fixed size limitation of traditional arrays
    </p>

    <h2>Dynamic Arrays</h2>
    <p><b>What they are:</b></p>
    <p>
      Dynamic array are resizable arrays that automatically handle the process
      of resize when the array reaches its capacity. In some languages, like
      python, the built-in list type provides dynamic array functionality
    </p>
    <p><b>What they are used for: </b></p>
    <p>
      Dynamic arrays are used when you need an array that can grow or shrink
      efficiently. They are suitable for scenarios where the number of elements
      may change, and you want to balance the benefits of constant-time random
      access with the flexibility of dynamic resizing
